SERMON SAVER

For many Christians part of our attendance at church usually includes jotting down notes from the message￼ that the pastor or speaker￼ presented.￼ 


While some churches provide bulletins for you to write your notes in, others don’t. This leaves many Christians having to have multiple pieces of paper (or multiple note books) with notes from various messages which can become hard to keep up with.

I created the sermon saver to be able to have a one-stop-shop to store all of your notes from messages. This app also  includes a space to put the URL (if the message was recodred) just in case you want to go back and watch the message again, keep track of the speaker who gave the message, as well as a categorize your notes based on the topic.



**This application is equipped with both a front and and back end.  


The following instructions will walk you through how to launch this app successfully.

Requirements:

Be sure to first fork in clone both the front and back and repos to your computer from github. 
1.) ss_notes_frontend
2.)ss_notes_backend

**Make sure that you have  Ruby on rails installed on your local machine.￼￼ (backend is a rails application) For further instructions on how to install rails visit => https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html

*Launching the back end:
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ Inside of the ss_notes_backend repo, launch your rails server by typing "rails s" or "rails server" into your computer terminal.


*Launching the front end:
Once you have the backend launched, open your ss_frontend repo. To access the app you can simply type the command "open index.html" and this will open up a webpage for you to view the application.



Once the application has been fully launched you can begin to create a new note for yourself. At the top of the webpage there is a form for you to fill out to be able to add as many notes as you like including the title, description, speaker, link, and then finally selecting the topic that the message was on.


Enjoy! ￼￼￼￼
